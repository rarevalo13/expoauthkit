# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) with authentication handled by [WorkOS](https://workos.com).

## Get started by cloning the repo and running `npm install`

You'll need to sign up for a WorkOS account by going to [WorkOS](https://signin.workos.com/sign-up) 

Once you've logged in you can get your secret key and client ID.

If you haven't already, you'll need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following variables:

```
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=
WORKOS_CLIENT_SECRET=
WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI=
```

Happy authenticating!
